# pandemic_pollution_evaluation
Small environmental science portfolio project using time series analysis methods to evaluate the effect - if any - that the pandemic had on atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.

This repo contains 6 files. The Jupyter notebook contains the data analysis on two carbon dioxide level datasets from https://gml.noaa.gov/ccgg/. The numerical data from the two datasets are included in two CSV files. Each of these datasets had a header which details use rights, which I removed and attached as txt files. Please read these, especially if one intends on using the datasets for scientific publication or presentation. Finally, I include an open source paper which provides extra insights on the effect of the first year of the pandemic on carbon dioxide levels. Said paper also corroborates the main conclusions of the analysis. I do not claim authorship or coauthorship of said paper, it is merely included to help contextualise background information that is not included in detail in the report.
